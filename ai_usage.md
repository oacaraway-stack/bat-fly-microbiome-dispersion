# AI Usage Statement

## AI Tools Used
This project used ChatGPT (OpenAI) to assist with writing and debugging analysis code in R for microbiome dispersion analyses. AI assistance was used for code structure suggestions, function selection, and troubleshooting errors.

## Human Oversight and Verification
All AI-generated code was reviewed, edited, and executed by Olivia Caraway. Outputs were verified by:
- Ensuring code ran without errors
- Confirming results were biologically and statistically reasonable
- Comparing outputs to expected patterns within original study
- Inspecting figures and summary statistics for variances that were too extensive 

No AI-generated results were accepted without manual review.

## Ethical and Data Privacy 
- All data used in this project was derived from previously published, de-identified datasets. No sensitive, personal, or private information was processed using AI tools. AI usage complied with institutional academic integrity guidelines.
- All data was not utilized, analyses was differentiated from original study to ensure independent observation and avoid copy right.
